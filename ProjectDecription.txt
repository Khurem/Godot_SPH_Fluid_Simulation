Hello and welcome to the project description. 

1. FEATURES IMPLEMENTED
    a. Basic Requirements 
        Cubic room w/ 6 walls ----------------------------IMPLEMENTED
        3 textured spherical balls w/ motion -------------IMPLEMENTED
        GDNative Script used for balls and wall normals---IMPLEMENTED
    b. Extra Credit
        None

2. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
    a. Lighting
        -One Directional Light is added in the scene (top-left from camera) that simulates the sun
        -One OmniLight is also in the scene in the bottom
        -One PointLight on the wall on the right hand side of the camera
    b. Scripts
        -If for some unholy reason the scripts are not attached to the nodes like they should be, here's where they belong:
            -asn1.gdns attaches to any and all spheres(the Spatial nodes of the spheres)
            -gdwall.gdns attaches to the Spatial nodes at the root of all walls

3. HOW TO USE
    a. There is a linux executable you can find inside the Project folder titled: "assignment1_exec" 
    b. Otherwise, in Godot you can pull up Main.tscn and run that to view the same thing

4. C++ FILES FOR SCRIPTS
    a. GDSpatial.cpp and GDSpatial.h for the spheres/balls
    b. GDWall.cpp and GDWall.h for the walls(pretty much just the normals)
